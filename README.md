spravkaru.net-crawler
=====================

Bunch of sh files to crawl spravkaru.net website and get the tsv list of names, phone numbers and addresses from it, given streets URL list.

Tested to be working on Aug 17th, 2014 on Mac OS X 10.9.4

Frankly speaking this could be much cleaner ruby/python/go code, but vanilla sh is so fun to handle errors, you know ;)
